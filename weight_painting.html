    <h1>Weight painting</h1>
    <p>This can be the most challenging part of rigging a character. But it is important to do if you want your
        character to behave properly.</p>
    <p>Weight painting is the final step so make sure you are happy with your rig before you start. If you have made a
        good model and rigged and skinned it well you should only need to do minor weight painting.</p>
    <h2>Why do I need to weight paint?</h2>
    <p>In the last worksheet we created a skeleton and bounded it to our character mesh in a process called skinning.
    </p>
    <p>Each bone in the skeleton has influence over some of the veracities of our mesh. Maya distributes this influence
        intelligently based on your preferences, but generally, the closer the vertex is to a joint, the more influence
        it has.</p>
    <p>You can see this on the head, if you rotate the head forward the chest moves, the mouth opens and the eyes shift
        in their sockets because the neck has too much influence over the bottom of the head and the top of the chest.
    </p>
    <p><img src="images/head_move.gif" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Weight painting is the process of re-distributing this influence. In this case, we want the head joint to
        dominate all the vertices in the head, and the neck to give up some of its influence on the chest.</p>
    <h2>Save</h2>
    <p>It is very important that you save a copy of your scene before you start. It is very easy to find you have made
        the weights worse and it that situation its easier to just re-open the old file rather than try to repair it.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Save you project under a different name</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Start Weight Painting</h2>
    <h3>Open the Weight painting tools</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Open the Rigging tab along the top and <strong>double click</strong> <strong>Paint Skin Weights</strong>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/paint_skin_wieghts.png" alt="paint skin weights tool" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Select the body mesh.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/body_mesh.png" alt="" /></p>
    <h3>Weight painting tools</h3>
    <p>The box at the top lets you select the different joints in your skeleton, When you select a joint the you can see
        the influence it has on the mesh.</p>
    <p><img src="images/select_joint.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>You can see here I have the hip joint selected.</p>
    <p>The Areas that are whitest are influenced most by the hip joint, the white colour fades out showing how the
        influence reduces as it goes up the body and down the legs.</p>
    <h3>Head</h3>
    <p>First we are going to fix the head.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click on the head joint in the influences panel.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/head_joint.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Bellow this panel is the brush settings. Make sure yours match mine. We want to replace the existing weights
        using a solid brush with an opacity of 1 and a value of 1.</p>
    <p><img src="images/weight_painting_brush_settings.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>We want to paint the head so it is completely white so that the head joint has complete control. The neck should
        be grey as this should flex when the head is moved.</p>
    <p>It can be useful to switch to colour ramp mode so you have a better idea of what you are painting. White is full
        influence, and blue is minimal influence.</p>
    <p><img src="images/colour_ramp.png" alt="" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Paint the head completely white. be very careful not to paint the body as well. If you do just undo and try
            again.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To make the brush larger hold down the <strong>b</strong> key and the left mouse button whist moving the mouse
        left and right.</p>
    <p><img src="images/weight_painting_brush_size.gif" alt="" /></p>
    <p>You should end up with this:</p>
    <p><img src="images/white_head.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>We can now smooth the transition from head to neck using the smooth operation and a smaller brush.</p>
    <p><img src="images/smooth.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Now Try rotating the head controller, the eyes and mouth should stay in the right place and the head shouldn't
        folder over like it did before.</p>
    <p><img src="images/fixed_head.gif" alt="" /></p>
    <h3>Neck</h3>
    <p>The head is fixed, but we still have some work to do on the neck so the chest doesn't rise up.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Select the body, and double click the weight painting tool again to open it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/paint_skin_wieghts.png" alt="paint skin weights tool" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Select the neck</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/neck.png" alt="" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Change the brush settings so that we are replacing the values with 0, this will paint black, removing the
            influence.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/replace.png" alt="" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Paint out the colour on the chest and then smooth the transition on neck using the smooth operation</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/neck_fixed.png" alt="" /></p>
    <h3>Other issues</h3>
    <p>The rest of the mesh seems OK, but look out for other issues on your rig that you will need to fix.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If one foot moves does it move the other foot?</li>
        <li>When you shoulder moves, does it move the cheek?</li>
        <li>When you move the leg, does the chest move?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you need to alter the arms or legs, you just need to fix one side, then mirror the weights using <strong>skin
            &gt; mirror skin weights</strong> in the top menu.</p>
    <p>If you find you have a lot to fix, you may want to consider going back a step and improving the original mesh or
        rigging.</p>
