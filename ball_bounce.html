    <h1>Animation basics</h1>
    <p>This worksheet covers the fundamental skills needed to animate in Maya.</p>
    <h3>Create a new scene</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Open Maya and create a new scene</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Create the ground</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a ground plane by <strong>Double clicking</strong> on the polygon Plane button to open the polygon
            plane options panel.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/make_plane.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Set the width and height to 100 and the divisions to 1.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/plane_settings.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>It is always a good idea to rename things as you go, so rename the new plane to "ground" in the outliner.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/ground.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <h3>Create a ball</h3>
    <p><strong>Double click</strong> on the polygon sphere button</p>
    <p><img src="images/make_sphere.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Set the radius to 10 and the divisions to 20</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/sphere_settings.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Rename it to "ball" in the outliner.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Challenge</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Give the ball a colour or a texture.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Make sure you name the new texture appropriately and you can see it in the ball.</p>
    <p>(HINT: With the ball selected right click and choose "Assign new material" )</p>
    <h2>Animation workspace</h2>
    <p>Now that we have set up our scene we can start to animate.</p>
    <p>When animating it will be helpful to have access to different panel.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Change the workspace to Animation in the top right corner of the screen</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/animation_workspace.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <h3>Tour of workspace</h3>
    <p>On the right we have the <strong>channel box</strong> this is where we can keyframe the properties we want to
        animate.</p>
    <p><img src="images/channel_box.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <p>At the bottom of the screen is the <strong>range slider</strong>, this is where we change the settings for the
        animation</p>
    <p><img src="images/animation_settings.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Above this is the <strong>timeline</strong>, this shows us which frame we are currently looking at and where we
        have set keyframes on the selected object.</p>
    <p><img src="images/timeline.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Finally, we have the graph editor, this shows how each keyframe transitions to the next.</p>
    <p><img src="images/graph_editor.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <p>We will use all these panels in the worksheet.</p>
    <h2>Animation settings</h2>
    <p>We want the animation to run at 30 frames per second (FPS) and the total animation to be a 3 seconds long.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <strong>range slider</strong> panel change the FPS to <strong>30 fps</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/30_fps.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>To the left Change the number on the right to 90, this is the total number of frames in our animation ( 3
            seconds @ 30fps)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/range.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Move the slider to the far left, and change the right hand number to 60. This shows the range currently
                viewable in the timeline above (frame 1 - 60, which equates to 2 seconds of time).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Lastly, click on the <strong>time slider preferences</strong> button in the bottom right to open the
                panel</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/time_slider_preferences.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Change the playback speed to <strong>30fps x 1</strong> this will ensure the time line plays our animation
            at the correct speed when we press play.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/playback_speed.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <h2>Create a key frame</h2>
    <p>Now that we have set up the workspace we can start to animate.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click on the far left of the time slider to select the first frame.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/frame_1.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Select the ball and move it to 100 on the y axis. You can do this by using the move tool (w on the keyboard)
            or typing 100 in the channel box.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/ball_position.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <p>-To set a key frame, right click on <strong>Translate y</strong> in the channel box and select <strong>Key
            selected</strong></p>
    <p><img src="images/key_selected.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <p>The property should turn red to indicate that it has a key frame, you should also see a red line on the timeline
        on frame 1.</p>
    <p><img src="images/first_frame_screen.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <h3>Another keyframe</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Now move the playhead on the time slider to frame 15</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/15.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Move the ball down so that it is just touching the ground, it may be helpful to go into the side view but
                it should be 10 as that is the radius of the ball.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Keyframe the ball again by right clicking on the Translate Y property in the channel box and choosing
                <strong>Key selected</strong>.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You should now have 2 red lines on the time line indicating 2 keyframes.</p>
    <p><img src="images/two_keyframes.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <h3>Set some more keyframes</h3>
    <p>You can now set the last few keyframes on your own, we want the ball to bounce twice, so set the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>at frame 30, set <strong>translate y</strong> to 90</li>
        <li>at frame 45, set <strong>translate y</strong> to 10</li>
        <li>at frame 60, set <strong>translate y</strong> to 80</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Play the animation</h2>
    <p>You can now play your animation by clicking on the play button to the right of the timeline (shortcut is
        <strong>alt/option + v</strong>)</p>
    <p><img src="images/play_animation.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <p><img src="images/floaty.gif" alt="" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Make sure yours looks like the animation above, if not work out where you went wrong.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Closely watch your animation, it should be going up and down but it doesn't really look like its
                bouncing. Why does it look wrong?</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Graph editor</h2>
    <p>With the ball selected, hover over the graph editor and press <strong>f</strong> on the keyboard so that the
        complete graph fills the panel.</p>
    <p><img src="images/floaty_graph.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <p>The yellow diamonds show where you have set keyframes, the green line shows where Maya has created a smooth
        transition between the keyframes.</p>
    <p>To make the bounce more realistic we want to edit this line to create a sharp change of direction on the bottom
        where it hits the floor and increase the curve on the top.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Select the second keyframe on the graph editor so you can see the handles sticking out the side.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/second_keyframe.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <p>You can move the handles around to change the shape of the curve, but we want to move them around independently.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Right click</strong> on keyframe and select <strong>break keyframes</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/break_tangents.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <p>We can now move each handle independently but we also want to change the length so we have full control.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Right click the keyframe again and choose <strong>weighted tangents</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/weighted_tangents.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Move the handles to create a v shape at the bottom of the bounce.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/graph_bounce_one.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can now alter all the keyframes to create a sharp change in direction at the bottom of the bounce, and a
            gentle curve at the top.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/curved_graph.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <p>play the animation again to see the result.</p>
    <p><img src="images/hard_bounce.gif" alt="" /></p>
    <h2>Squash and Stretch</h2>
    <p>This is one of the most important principles in animation.</p>
    <p>When an object moves or collides with something it will deform.</p>
    <p>If your object is made of a rubbery or flexible material it will deform more.</p>
    <h3>Top of the bounce</h3>
    <p>firstly, we want the ball to stay spherical at the top of the bounce.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Select frame 1, and keyframe Scale X, Scale Y and Scale Z at 1.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/frame_1_on_graph.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <p><img src="images/key_scale.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do the same thing on Frame 30 and 60.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>bottom of the bounce</h3>
    <p>We can now keyframe the squash when it hits the ground.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Move to frame 15 and squash the ball vertically by reducing the Y Scale and keyframing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To conserve the balls volume, this means we need to simultaneously stretch it horizontally</p>
    <ul>
        <li>increase the Scale X and Scale Z and keyframe. I have used 1.3 and 0.7.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/key_squash.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <p>You should notice that the ball now doesn't hit the ground.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Adjust and translate y so that the ball hits the floor at frame 15 and key it again.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/contact_floor.PNG" alt="" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Do the same for the second bounce at frame 45 and then look at your animation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Why does it look wrong now? How can we fix it?</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/squash_bounce.gif" alt="" /></p>
    <h3>Refine the animation</h3>
    <p>We have a similar issue as before, Maya is smoothing out the transition between keyframes so the ball starts to
        squash as it falls.</p>
    <p>To fix this we need the ball to remain spherical until just before it hits the ground.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>On frame 14, just before the ball hits the ground, key the x, y and z scale of the ball to 1.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Do the same thing on frame 44.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You also need to key frame the scale a few frames after the bounce so it returns to its original shape quicker.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add a keyframe to frame 18 and 48, keying the balls x, y and z scale back to 1.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Final animation</h2>
    <p>We now have a basic ball animation and you have covered all the basic skills of animating simple object in Maya.
    </p>
    <p><img src="images/ball_final.gif" alt="" /></p>
    <h2>Final challenge</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Add a keyframes to translate x or translate z to move it sideways as it bounces.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Try changing the amount you squash and stretch the ball, can you make it look like its made of a harder
                material?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>What happens if you rotate the ball so that it spins as it move? consider how you may animate this in a
                different order next time to fix any issues.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
